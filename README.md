# Project Euler using Rust

Project Euler computer science challenges solved using Rust.

## What is Project Euler?

* Project Euler is a series of computer science challenges of increasing complexity. 
* These challenges are matheamtical in nature, but are well suited to being solved using computer science methodology.
* Project Euler was inspired by mathschallenge.net, a similar series of challenges for math.
* Upon completing a specific challenge, a guided solution is provided to help improve your problem solving process.
